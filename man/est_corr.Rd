\usage{
est_corr(df, x, y, cil = 0.95, bin_num = 30, save_as = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe.}

\item{x}{Quantitative predictor variable of interest found in the dataframe. \cr It is given by a column containing only categories (words, letters, numbers).}

\item{y}{Quantitative response variable of interest found in the dataframe. \cr It is given by a column containing only categories (words, letters, numbers).}

\item{cil}{Confidence Interval Levels. \cr They are floats from 0 to 1; where the default value is 0.95, corresponding to 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{bin_num}{Number of bins to use in the histogram. \cr The default number of bins is 30.}

\item{save_as}{Exports the generated histogram as pdf, jpeg, or png. \cr The default setting is \code{NULL}, which does not export the graph. It is necessary to add quotation-marks to the desired format for exporting the graph: "pdf", "jpeg" or "png".}
}
\description{
Response variable: quantitative. \cr \cr

Here you are able to obtain the sample correlation and the confidence interval that captures the true population correlation. \cr \cr
This function relies in a randomization-based estimation. Firstly, it constructs a bootstrap distribution in order to approximate the standard error of statistic of interest (sample correlation). Then, it computes a confidence interval for the population parameter (population correlation).

[1] The sample mean is 0.59
