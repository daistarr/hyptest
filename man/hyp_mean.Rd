\usage{
hyp_mean(df, x, condition, nullhyp, cil = 0.95, bin_num = 30, save_as = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe.}

\item{x}{Quantitative variable of interest found in the dataframe. \cr It is given by a column containing only numbers.}

\item{condition}{The direction of the alternative hypothesis. \cr \cr A two-sided alternative hypothesis is given by "different" and it consists of the extreme areas in both sides on the null distribution. It is useful to compare if the sample mean is different from a estimate about the true mean of the population. \cr \cr An one-sided alternative hypothesis is given by "less" or "greater" and it consists of the extreme area in one tail. To compare if the mean is smaller than a estimate about the true mean of the population, use "less". To compare if the mean is bigger than a estimate about the true mean of the population, use "greater".}

\item{nullhyp}{The estimate about the true mean of the population that will be used in the null hypothesis.}

\item{cil}{Confidence Interval Levels. \cr They are floats from 0 to 1; where the default value is 0.95, corresponding to 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{bin_num}{Number of bins to use in the histogram. \cr The default number of bins is 30.}

\item{save_as}{Exports the generated histogram as pdf, jpeg, or png. \cr The default setting is \code{NULL}, which does not export the graph. It is necessary to add quotation-marks to the desired format for exporting the graph: "pdf", "jpeg" or "png".}

\description{
Response variable: quantitative. \cr \cr
Here you are able to obtain the sample mean and the confidence interval that captures the true population mean. \cr \cr
This function relies in a randomization-based estimation. Firstly, it specify the variable of interest, followed by the construction of the null distribution followed by the computation of the sample statistic (sample mean).

\if{html}{This histogram was created by the est_mean function and data from the \code{\link{palmerpenguins}}. It tests if the mean of bill lenght (bill_length_mm) of the sample is less than 44.5.

[1] "The alternative hypothesis, the one that you actually testing for, is that the mean of bill_length_mm is less than 44.5"
[1] "Possible Interpretation: The p-value is small and the sample data represents evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis."
