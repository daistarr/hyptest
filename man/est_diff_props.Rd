\usage{
est_diff_props(
  df,
  catprop,
  prop1,
  prop2,
  catarget,
  target,
  cil = 0.95,
  bin_num = 30,

\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe.}

\item{catprop}{Categorical variable of interest, representing the predictor variable, found in the dataframe that contains the categories of interest. \cr It is given by a column containing only categories.}

\item{prop1}{First category of interest found within \code{catprop}. \cr It is necessary to add quotation-marks to call the desired category.}

\item{prop2}{Second category of interest found within \code{catprop}. \cr It is necessary to add quotation-marks to call the desired category.}

\item{catarget}{Binary categorical variable of interest, representing the response variable, found in the dataframe that contains the categories of interest. \cr It is given by a column containing only categories.}

\item{target}{Category of interest found within \code{catarget}. \cr It is necessary to add quotation-marks to call the desired category.}

\item{cil}{Confidence Interval Levels. \cr They are floats from 0 to 1; where the default value is 0.95, corresponding to 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{bin_num}{Number of bins to use in the histogram. \cr The default number of bins is 30.}

\item{save_as}{Exports the generated histogram as pdf, jpeg, or png. \cr The default setting is \code{NULL}, which does not export the graph. It is necessary to add quotation-marks to the desired format for exporting the graph: "pdf", "jpeg" or "png".}

\description{
Response variable: categorical. \cr
Explanatory variable: binary, categorical \cr \cr
Here you are able to obtain the difference in two sample proportions and the confidence interval that captures the true difference between two proportions within the population. \cr \cr
This function relies in a randomization-based estimation. Firstly, it constructs a bootstrap distribution in order to approximate the standard error of statistic of interest (difference in two proportion means). Then, it computes a confidence interval for the population parameter (difference in two population proportions).

est_diff_props(penguins, island, "Torgersen", "Dream", species, "Adelie", cil= 0.99, save_as = "png")

[1] The difference in sample proportions is 0.55
[1] The true difference in population proportions is between 0.44 and 0.67 at 99\% confidence interval
